                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>I’m a Web developer and Graphic Designer looking for work that will utilise the skills I have acquired. Most recently, I am an online English teacher, teaching children who's ages range from 5 to 17 years of age.  While living in New Zealand, I was employed at the Police National Headquarters, analysing software and its effectiveness to serve both the police and our clients.
                It was here that a flame was reignited around creative processes and solutions that really serve the user.
 I am a team orientated person who is well spoken energetic, confident and personable.
I enjoy working with people and have had a wide experience working in other countries (including non-english speaking countries).
I’m hoping that with the skills I have obtained will provide me with an interactive learning experience that is challenging and self enhancing.</p>

                <p> <!--Create bullet points-->

For this role I had to hit the ground running in an established team. I had to constantly demonstrate my analysing and decision making capabilities while growing key relationships with internal and external clients.
I had to establish and maintain appropriate internal and external working relationships with Police Staff, government agencies and the general public.
Some of the many tasks I was involved in are:
Processing vetting applications for approved agencies such as New Zealand Immigration, Department of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice, NZTA etc while keeping to the strict service level agreement. Responding to phone calls and correspondence from individuals and approved organisations for guidance on vetting processes and the release of information.
Evaluating all positive identifications, ensuring that names and aliases are matched and responding to Official Information Act and Privacy Act requests for release of personal information.
Evaluating CRN(Criminal Record Number) transfers which are unique numbers assigned to a specific or singular charge to reconcile entries with the correct identities and arranging for Ministry of Justice to transfer charge details.
Provided advice on National Intelligence Application (NIA) data entry to Police staff and updating personal information where required.
Resolving identity issues in NIA.
