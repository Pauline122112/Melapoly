            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>I’m a Web developer and Graphic Designer looking for work that will utilise the skills I have acquired. Most recently, I am an online English teacher, teaching children who's ages range from 5 to 17 years of age. While living in New Zealand,
                I was employed at the Police National Headquarters, analysing software and its effectiveness to serve both the police and our clients. It was here that a flame was reignited around creative processes and solutions that really serve the
                user. I am a team orientated person who is well spoken energetic, confident and personable. I enjoy working with people and have had a wide experience working in other countries (including non-english speaking countries). I’m hoping that
                with the skills I have obtained will provide me with an interactive learning experience that is challenging and self enhancing.</p>
