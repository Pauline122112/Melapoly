                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>I’m a Web developer and Graphic Designer looking for work that will utilise the skills I have acquired. Most recently, I am an online English teacher, teaching children who's ages range from 5 to 17 years of age.  While living in New Zealand, I was employed at the Police National Headquarters, analysing software and its effectiveness to serve both the police and our clients.
                It was here that a flame was reignited around creative processes and solutions that really serve the user.
 I am a team orientated person who is well spoken energetic, confident and personable.
I enjoy working with people and have had a wide experience working in other countries (including non-english speaking countries).
I’m hoping that with the skills I have obtained will provide me with an interactive learning experience that is challenging and self enhancing.</p>
